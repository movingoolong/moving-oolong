                Weâ€™re Asian American young women who started this podcast to share our stories and growing pains of preparing to graduate college.
                Our intersecting identities as Asian American women play a large role in shaping our experiences as young adults and we hope this podcast acts as a time-capsule to remember and reflect on this time of transition in our lives.
                We invite you to listen & enjoy stories of us moving along!
