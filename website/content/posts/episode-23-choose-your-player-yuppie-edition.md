*yup·pie /ˈyəpē/ — young, urban professional*

We have a very special episode for this week with not one, not two, but 3 guests! While postgrad & career moves have been a common topic for us, we thought you might be tired of hearing just our perspectives...

\
All 3 are our good friends & recent grads from UMD, but each have very different postgrad futures at a Big Four company, US government agency, and tech development program.
