We just missed Valentine’s day, but we hope the results from our rigorous review of 6 unique dating apps will still be helpful in your quest for love. 

That’s right, in this week’s episode we compare 4 obscure/niche dating apps with 2 classic ones that you may already have on your phone. Although we have 20 pt. rubric, we did this app review just for fun and laughs, and it shouldn’t be taken too seriously. If you’ve had success with EME Hive or Christian Mingle, let us know!
