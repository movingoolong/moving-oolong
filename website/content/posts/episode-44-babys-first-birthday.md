Whatttt can you believe Moving Oolong turns 1 year old this week ðŸ¥³ ðŸŽ‚

Itâ€™s almost hard to believe that one year ago, pre-COVID and pre-graduation, the three of us decided to upload a voice recording and create Moving Oolong ðŸ¥²

I donâ€™t think we need to say it, but a lot has happened over this past year. So, join us for one final episode of season 2 where we have an honest conversation about this year, what weâ€™ve learned from podcasting, and the future of Moving Oolong...

P.S. weâ€™ll be taking a short break over the holidays and be back in 2021 with season 3!
