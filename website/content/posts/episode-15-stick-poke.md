Episode 15 is all about our \~body modifications\~ from first piercings to Taiwanese tattoos.

We talk about our various tattoos/piercings, their meanings, and our parents’ reactions! Plus we answer the question our parents have all asked—will we get more soon...?

\[Disclaimer: This episode is not a credible guide on how to tattoo or pierce anyone, this is just for entertainment]

Listen along & leave a comment below if you'd get a tattoo as a tourist!
