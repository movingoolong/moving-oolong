This week we’re keeping up with the...kitchen  and getting an inside look at the culinary world thanks to our special guest, Kathy Chen 👩🏻‍🍳

Kathy shares her experience attending a top culinary school in NYC and discusses what it’s like to be an East Asian American woman entering a still male-dominated field in the US.
