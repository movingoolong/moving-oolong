While weâ€™ve taken the past few weeks to center the Black Lives Matter movement & share Black hosted podcasts, itâ€™s important to realize that this is not a trend.

Feel free to continue to check out [resources](https://blacklivesmatter.carrd.co/) weâ€™ve saved (in our IG stories) for being allies & additional lists of Black hosted podcasts.

July = halfway through the year ðŸ˜®  Plus, this week weâ€™re kickstarting our **2nd season**!! Itâ€™s been over a month since weâ€™ve graduated and we still canâ€™t help but feel uncertain of what the future holds for us. So we decided to take a pause & reflect on the year so far.

If you havenâ€™t listened to our [2020 resolutions episode](https://www.movingoolongpod.com/episode-4-new-decade-new-us-1/) yet, go ahead and give it a listen first. Then come back for todayâ€™s episode where we discuss the goals we made in January. Find out if we stuck with them and learn about our new goals for the remainder of 2020!
