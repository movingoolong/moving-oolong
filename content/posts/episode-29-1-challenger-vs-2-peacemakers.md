So you know our [sun signs](https://www.movingoolongpod.com/episode-10-stars-signs-read-our-minds/) and [MBTI types](https://www.movingoolongpod.com/episode-2-myers-briggs-decide-our-careers/), but do you know our enneagram types??

This week we try to understand the basics of the enneagram system & symbol (shoutout to our mans, Pythagoras) and then use that knowledge to guess each other’s types! Spoiler alert: we don’t know each other as well as we thought…

Tune in for a fun episode about this complicated system & how it compares to other personality tests!
