We finally had the talk… with our first ever guest, Hannah! 🎉

She works with our university health center as a sexual health educator, but most importantly, she’s been a friend of ours ever since freshman year of college.

Join us this week as we finally get the sex education we never had! From virginity to consent to sex shops, we reminisce about our own firsts and explore more about what the “birds and the bees” really means.
