New year, new season!! We’re back with a brand new season and bunch of exciting episodes coming your way! 



With each new year we like to take the time to reflect and set our personal goals, but for 2021 we’re mixing it up a bit by writing letters to the future Linda, Sally, and Ming. 

If you’re all caught up with Seasons 1 & 2, jump back in and join us for a sweet and sentimental episode. 



What do you think you’ll be like in 2029?
