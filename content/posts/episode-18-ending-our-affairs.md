For our 18th episode, we have our second ever guest— Christine Rhee!

Christine is a fellow graduating senior and, just like all of us, she has worked at numerous on-campus jobs while being a full-time student.

This week, Christine helps us define “student affairs” as we break down the pros and cons of having a job on campus. We discuss our own experiences and have a brief story time to tell our wildest stories from working in student affairs!

Leave a comment with your own thoughts about student affairs or on-campus jobs!
