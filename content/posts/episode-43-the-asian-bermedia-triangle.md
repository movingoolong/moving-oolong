Let's get lost in the Asian BerMEDIA Triangle!

For this season's penultimate episode, we're doing another Asian media review, but in a slightly different style. Join us for 3 mini talks where each of us take on one side of the Asian media triangle (shows/dramas, music/k-pop, and books) to recommend and discuss. Linda also shares [her study on LGBTQ+ Asian American identity and the role of Kpop](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00918369.2020.1815428?forwardService=showFullText&tokenAccess=B2APQPWSVBPWFP7VYJDU&tokenDomain=eprints&doi=10.1080%2F00918369.2020.1815428&doi=10.1080%2F00918369.2020.1815428&doi=10.1080%2F00918369.2020.1815428&target=10.1080%2F00918369.2020.1815428&journalCode=wjhm20).
