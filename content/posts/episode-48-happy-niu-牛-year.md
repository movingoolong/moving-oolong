新年快乐！恭喜发财！

In 4 days it will be lunar new year and the year of the ox (牛) will begin 🐂

We always have an episode marking the start of solar new year, but this time we decided to share our favorite foods 🍊🥟 and traditions of Chinese New Year.  

Also join us for a surprise guest cameo and an unplanned conversation about cultural appropriation.
