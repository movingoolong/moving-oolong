We’re one day out from Election Day 2020 and today we add our own voices to the on-going conversation about electoral politics.

Tune in to hear us explore topics like talking politics with family, why Asian Americans are often perceived as politically apathetic, and the limitations of voting. If that’s not interesting enough, our good friend, Sebastian also joins us to share his unique story as a biochem major turned Democratic fundraiser.
