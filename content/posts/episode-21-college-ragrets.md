*Alexa, play “Pomp and Circumstance”*

By the time this episode is released, we’ll all be alumni of the University of Maryland!

Of course since we’ve been talking about our college experiences and post-grad ideas since the beginning of this podcast, we had to have a whole episode dedicated to our college regrets.

We also end up talking about imposter syndrome and our plans as official postgrads.

Congratulations to all 2020 grads! We did it!
