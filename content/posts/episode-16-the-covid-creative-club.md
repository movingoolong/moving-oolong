Welcome to the COVID Creative Club! We all know someone who’s started making bread or playing Animal Crossing while social isolating at home…

This week we share all the hobbies and creative projects we just started or have been doing way before the pandemic started. From pottery to [zines](https://gumroad.com/buppletea) to learning [html](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF_Xl5TOGlY), we also talk monetization and the role of social media 💸💸

Check out the [fabric face mask instructions](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html) that we mention in the episode & try to make some for you and your family!
