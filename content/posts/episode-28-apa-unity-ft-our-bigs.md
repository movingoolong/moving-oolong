You’ve already met [Vincent](https://www.movingoolongpod.com/episode-23-choose-your-player-yuppie-edition/), but we’d now like to introduce the remainder of the TASA Bigs trifecta: Albert Wang & Peter Tran!

If you’ve listened to any of our past episodes, you know being members of TASA definitely shaped our undergrad experience & a BIG part of that was due to the Big/Little family system.

In this episode we talk all things TASA, from what we hoped to gain from a Taiwanese club to all the past election drama. We also discuss our different perspectives of the broader Asian American community at UMD & debate the potential opportunities each organization can bring to students.
