Do you call it boba or bubble tea? Freeway or highway? We brought on our old high school friend, Jethro, to talk about the difference between U.S. west coast and east coast culture. 

Jethro went to school with us in Maryland, but he’s lived all over the world and spent the last few years in Northern California and Las Vegas. Join us to hear why he thinks #WestCoastBestCoast.
