This week’s episode is all about our favorite topic, FOOD \*chef’s kiss\* 👌🏼⁣

Join us for a fun, lighthearted ep where we talk about our childhood memories of food, culinary traditions, & that one time we transported our handmade dumplings in trash bags...

(PS - Listen with headphones on for a satisfying surprise)
