You asked, we answered! In our 7th episode, we answer all the questions!

The three of us were friends way back before this podcast began, so this week we start with a story time of how we met. We talk about our first impressions of each other and then dive deep with questions for each other. Inspired by Mandy Len Catronâ€™s [essay](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/11/style/modern-love-to-fall-in-love-with-anyone-do-this.html) about the [36 questions](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/11/style/36-questions-that-lead-to-love.html) that lead to love, we try to fall further into friendship love.

Listen to the very end to hear us answer the questions YOU asked about heartbreak and insecurities.
