Andddd we’re back! After 11 days of exploring and 35+ hours of traveling home, we’ve returned to the mic for episode 6 (our longest one yet).

Hopefully you’re not hungry, because in this episode we talk all about Taiwan’s food culture. We review our favorite night markets, discuss what it’s like to feel comfortable in a new country, and offer a few travel tips along the way!

There’s so much we didn’t get to touch on (the inspiring story of the Rainbow Village, group traveling dynamics, Taipei nightlife, & our obsession with Eslite stationary) so comment below if we missed any of your Taiwanese favorites or you’d like to hear more!
