🎉 We’ve finally made it to the end of season 3! For our 65th episode and the last one for a few weeks, we answered all your burning (random) questions from Instagram.

We talk interior design 🛋, interacting with our clones 👯‍♀️, and Ming’s five-year plan for her future 💍👀

Don’t fret! We’ll be back after a short summer break 🌞 

In the meantime, you can catch up on all our previous [64 episodes](https://www.movingoolongpod.com/episodes)!
