This week we’re in the mood to talk all things supernatural, mythological, and theological!



In this episode, Sally prompts us to share our favorite mythological creatures 🐉 , discuss whether we believe in life after death, and general musings about what real aliens look like 👽 🦠

Plus two of us grew up in a Christian household, so we couldn’t help bringing up theological thoughts on Jesus and historical context to legendary figures.
