Adoption in media sometimes seem like wonderful thing, and it definitely can be. But it’s also a grey area with complexities and social nuances that doesn’t get talked about much. In this episode, we first give you a crash course in transnational adoption history and then talk about our own, close relationship with adoption.

\[Episode 13 is part one of our personal origin stories, stay tuned for part 2 in the next episode.]

The New York Times article we reference can be found [here](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/18/magazine/why-a-generation-of-adoptees-is-returning-to-south-korea.html). Comment below if you're interested in learning more about Ming's adoption class!
