In honor of [Parasite’s historic Oscar wins](https://oscar.go.com/news/winners/parasite-wins-4-oscars-and-makes-oscar-history) and the release of [To All the Boys: PS I Still Love You](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/25/movies/to-all-the-boys-ps-i-still-love-you-noah-centineo-lana-candor.html), we’re talking about movies this week! Specifically, movies written by or starring Asian/Asian Americans.

Representation is a hot topic for Hollywood right now and we further discuss the responsibility an Asian American actor may or may not have to engage in the community and what type of media we should turn to in search for our own role models.

We bring up questions we definitely don’t have answers to and also debate #TeamJohn vs #TeamPeter (iykyk)
