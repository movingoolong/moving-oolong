This weekend was Loveboat, College Park aka ITASA ECC! In our 8th episode we talk about one of our favorite events of the semester, [Intercollegiate Taiwanese American Student Association’](https://itasa.org/)s annual East Coast Conference.

From food workshops about identity to meeting one of our inspirations, Mel from [Asian Boss Girl](https://www.asianbossgirl.com/), this is a quick debrief on all things ECC. We recorded this episode minutes after the workshops, so you’ll hear our immediate thoughts & impressions!
