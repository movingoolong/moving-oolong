For our 25th episode, we‚Äôre talking moola, cash, cheddar, dough ‚Äî MONEY üí∏

Sometimes talking about money or income can seem taboo and even we‚Äôve never had a deep money conversation... until now! We talk about all things money including who pays for the check in a relationship, when we got our first credit card, and the complexities of ‚Äúhustle culture‚Äù. 

Similar to our friendship episode, we also use a list of questions designed to start these important financial conversations ([*The 20 Questions You Should Ask Your S.O.* via Refinery29](https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2018/07/202646/money-questions-to-ask-your-romantic-partner))
