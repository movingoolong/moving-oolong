Just like everyone else, we jumped on a zoom call to record our 14th episode from the safety of our homes...⁣

We talked about Ming’s origin story as a transnational adoptee in Part 1, so in this episode we discuss Sally & Linda’s origins as 2nd generation Asian Americans. ⁣

From growing up in an immigrant household to social radicalization, we have a slightly impromptu conversation about identity politics & how we hope to make culture connections post-grad ⚡️
