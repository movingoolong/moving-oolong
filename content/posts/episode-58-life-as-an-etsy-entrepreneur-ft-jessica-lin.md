Feeling a little lost? On this week’s episode, we are joined by the wonderful, Jessica Lin, owner of *Lost As Jess*! 

Architect by day and jewelry designer by night, Jessica shares how she she felt “lost” in between jobs as a recent grad, but was inspired by the prosperity knots hanging in Chinatown. From there, she turned to her childhood of crafting and her design background to start her very own jewelry shop.
