We’re sipping and spilling the tea this week…imagine a truth or drink game, but with bubble tea!

Sally puts her new AZN Flush x KFT card game to use (“the world's first boba-themed game”) and we answer different questions like “story time”, “if this, then”, and “most likely to.” Tune in for a fun, lighthearted boba chat session to get a glimpse of the kind of conversations we have off-pod.
