Suns, moons, rising signs...oh my!

This week we talk all things stars & signs as we explore our astrological signs and birth charts. A few of us were skeptics to begin, but if you listen along you’ll see how we apply abstract signs to our real life. We also talk a bit about the Chinese zodiac & discuss the horoscope for 2020, the year of the metal rat.
