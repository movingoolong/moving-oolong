Cheers, mate! We’re back this week with a two-for-one guest episode on studying abroad ✈️ 

Obviously, traveling anywhere is limited now, but we can still mentally visit Madrid & Edinburgh with our guests, Dave & Tim!

Join us for a fun, random episode on traveling abroad as Asian Americans and tips for the application process at the end!
