We told you we had a lot in store for this season‚Ä¶ we‚Äôre excited to share our first ever podcaster guests, Crystal and Jeeso from [Eat Your Crust](https://eatyourcrust.com/)!¬†

Crystal and Jeesoo are both college grads from c/o 2018 so they‚Äôve had a few more years to figure out what it means to be post-grads working full time. On this episode, we chat about work-life balance, how to quit your first job, and how growing up in Silicon Valley impacted their career choices.¬†

After listening to our episode, head over to their pod to hear us debate Gen Z vs Millennial and the future of TikTok:
