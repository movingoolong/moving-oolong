It’s just us 姐姐 on this week’s episode... 

Did you know that all three of us are older sisters or jie jie (姐姐)? We all have experienced being the older kid, role model to our younger sibling, and parents’ first pancake 🥞🙃

On this ep we share our stories as the oldest child in the family and compare thoughts on [older sibling stereotypes](https://www.parents.com/baby/development/sibling-issues/how-birth-order-shapes-personality/) (are we all type A? Anxious and held to a higher standard?)
