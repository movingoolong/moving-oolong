Happy APAHM! Weâ€™re excited to have Vinh Dang on this week to share how he went from ignoring his Vietnamese culture in high school to leading a workshop on Asian American representation to volunteering as the director of communications at [ECAASU](https://www.ecaasu.org/) (in addition to his regular olâ€™ 9-5).Â 

Vinh also shares his views on boba liberalism, gives advice on getting involved in Asian American advocacy efforts post-grad, and spills what itâ€™s like to be Lindaâ€™s boss.Â 

Check out ECAASUâ€™s podcast, [Community Echos](https://open.spotify.com/show/1EVsomMyJvyNOhVcKHbRp8?si=fAKAbgfPSbGcl44tswCA9Q), co-hosted by Vinh!
