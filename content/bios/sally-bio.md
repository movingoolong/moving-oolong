Iâ€™m a Cantonese-Chinese Asian American; my mom is from Hong Kong and my dad is from Guangzhou. Recently, I studied Biochemistry and Microbiology while in college. I'm working in a post-grad research lab with the hopes to pursue a doctorate degree in the future. My favorite Asian dish to eat is peking duck wraps!
