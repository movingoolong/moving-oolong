I was adopted from Jiangxi, China by a single mother in 1999, so being a transracial/transnational adoptee has definitely shaped my experiences as an Asian American. 

In undergrad, I majored in Public Health Science with a minor in Asian American Studies and joined the Taiwanese American Student Association (TASA) with Sally and Linda. 

Now, I work full time in digital marketing at a patient assistance non-profit. 5-9 we record this podcast and I baby my tropical houseplants. Ask me about my mini greenhouse!
