I was adopted from Jiangxi, China by a single mother in 1999. I majored in Public Health Science with a minor in Asian American Studies. While in college, I helped organize Technica, an all-women and non-binary hackathon, and was also a Resident Assistant. My favorite Asian food is mapo tofu! I hope to pursue a career in Marketing/Communications for non-profits.
