I'm a storyteller of illustration and sequential art. I studied Public Health Science and American Studies at the University of Maryland. Currently, I'm pursuing work at the intersection of communications, advocacy, and inclusion. As a half-Taiwanese, half-Mongolian American my favorite Asian dish is tomato and egg!
