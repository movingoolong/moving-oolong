about-page: We’re Asian American young women who started this podcast to share
  our stories and growing pains as recent college graduates. Our intersecting
  identities as Asian American women play a large role in shaping our
  experiences as young adults and we hope this podcast acts as a time-capsule to
  remember and reflect on this time of transition in our lives. We invite you to
  listen & enjoy stories of us moving oolong!
